# Imprezja Quiz – Product Description for Payment Processor

## Short Description

**Imprezja Quiz** is a desktop application for running live quizzes and voting games at events (weddings, corporate parties, birthdays). Players join via their smartphones by scanning a QR code—no app download required. The host controls the game from an admin panel (PC or phone). Results are displayed on a TV or projector.

The product is similar to **Kahoot** in concept (live quiz, players answer on phones, real-time scoring), but targets a different use case: **offline events** where internet may be unavailable or unreliable, with **no player limit** and support for **simultaneous offline and online play**.

## How It Works

1. **Host** runs the app on a computer (Windows/macOS) in a local network.
2. **Players** scan a QR code to open the game in their browser—no installation needed.
3. Questions are shown on a shared screen (TV/projector); players answer on their phones.
4. Points are awarded in real time; the host can show rankings and a podium.

**Payment model:** One-time purchase or subscription for the host. Players do not pay; they only join the game via QR code.
